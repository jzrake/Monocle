/**
A directed acyclic graph data structure.

This class implements a directed acyclic graph. Nodes are identified by a
unique string key, and contain an Object data member. Edges in the graph
express the direction of data flow; if B has an "incoming edge", A -> B, then
B depends on A, or data flows from A to B. A node's incoming edges are unique
but not ordered. Edges must terminate on a concrete node, but they may
originate from nodes that are not actually in the graph. The data value of
nodes not in the graph is Object::None. Nodes have a dirty/clean status that
tracks the the insertion and removal of their upstream nodes.
